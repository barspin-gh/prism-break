  so, i think that you should add rockbox

  http://www.rockbox.org/   
  
  wich is an IOS remplacement for ipods.
  
  
  
  and you should also add Ekiga
  
  http://www.ekiga.org/
  
  wich is the skype remplacement.
  
  
    
  
  I dont know why did you made so complicated to the people to add and edit the webpage. it should be as debian  webpage.
  
  anyways... It is a good page.
